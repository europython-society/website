#### **Meet the Community**

#### The main goal of this summit is for various stakeholders of Pythonâ€™s Rust ecosystem to meet, learn, and discuss about the Rust ecosystem in Python, how Python can benefit from Rust, and anything related to the adaptation of thread-free Python.

We are particularly looking for contributors and maintainers of:

* Rust libraries / frameworks that have Python API interface (e.g. polars)
* Tools in the Python ecosystem that are built with Rust (e.g. ruff, uv etc)
* Python libraries that are migrating all or part of their source code to Rust code
* New Python libraries that are written in Rust
* Other Python projects that can benefit from using Rust

#### **Presentations**

If there is a topic you would like to present, please indicate it in the form and fill it in early.

Sparkling presentations are brief, and intended to get everyone on the same page and start a discussion. Time slots are of 30 min at most (10 min of presentation \+ 20 min for questions/discussion).

Deep dive presentations are 45 mins in total (35 mins presentation and 10 mins Q\&A). They can have more details and be a bit more informative, they should provide educational value to the participants.

We are also open to suggestions for unconference-style activities.
