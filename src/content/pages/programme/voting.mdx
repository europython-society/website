educational and entertaining programme.  Your feedback is an important
ingredient in this refinement and curation process.

## Our guiding principles

- Our EuroPython family will directly shape the conference programme.
- It is a blind process to guard against inevitable bias: speakers' names will
  not be displayed; submissions will be displayed in random order for each
  voting participant.
- It’s robust against anonymous manipulation: only identities already known to
  us can participate.

## Who can participate?

To be eligible to vote, you need an email address already  known to us, i.e.
one that has been used for any of the following:
 - You've registered for one of the past EuroPython conferences between 2022 - 2024;
 - You've submitted a proposal for 2025;

## How do I vote?

- Go to the [Community Voting page](https://voting.europython.eu).
- Enter an eligible email address (see [Who can
  participate](/programme/voting/#who-can-participate) above).
- If the email is known to us, you will receive an email with a confirmation
  link.
- Check your inbox (and spam) for the email with the confirmation link - click
  it and let the voting begin!

You should stay logged in by default. But if you are somehow logged out, just
use the confirmation link from the email again or re-enter your email address
to receive a new confirmation link.

### Don't remember which email was used for EuroPython?

- Try a few different emails you might have used.
- If you no longer have access to the email account once used to register for
  a past  conference, (e.g. it belongs to a previous employer), we
  unfortunately cannot add or change it for you.

### How does the voting system work?

For each submission, you can choose only one of four options

<div style={{textAlign: "center", marginBottom: 8}}>
<Button>Must see</Button>
<Button>Want to see</Button>
</div>
<div style={{textAlign: "center", marginBottom: 8}}>
<Button>Maybe</Button>
<Button>Not interested</Button>
</div>

- Your vote for each submission is automatically saved, but you can change it
  at any time before the voting phase ends.
- Whenever you refresh the page, the order of the submissions will be
  randomised again.
- You can filter submissions based on tracks you are interested in. You can
  also filter the ones you have not voted on.
- You are welcome to leave optional comments for each submission you vote on.
  They will only be shared with the programme team.

## Selection of Submissions

We believe that a good conference consists of popular talks as well as new or
niche topics - all by and for our diverse community. Ultimately, it is the
programme team who curate and are responsible for the final programme, but one
of the major factors upon which they rely, will be the preferences of the
community through this voting process.
