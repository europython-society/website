#### Meet the Community

The main goal of this summit is for various stakeholders of Python's C API to meet and discuss about the state of the API, existing challenges and ongoing work.

We are particularly looking for contributors and maintainers of:
- Python implementations with a C API (e.g., CPython, PyPy, GraalPy, MicroPython)
- Binding generators and alternative APIs (e.g., HPy, Cython, pybind11, PyO3, SWIG)
- Libraries that use the C API heavily or in innovative ways
- Applications that embed Python
- Similar projects working in this area

#### Presentations

If there is a topic you would like to present, please indicate it in the form and fill it in early.

Summit presentations are brief, intended to get everyone on the same page and start a discussion. Time slots are of 30min at most (10 min of presentation + 20 min for questions/discussion).

We are looking to discuss advanced topics.
